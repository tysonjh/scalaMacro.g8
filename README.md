# Scala Macro giter8 template

A giter8 template for a Scala macro project that uses the [macro paradise](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html) plugin. This is essentially the giter8ion of [scalamacros/sbt-example-paradise](https://github.com/scalamacros/sbt-example-paradise). It includes an sbt configuration for a `macro` project where the macro should be implemented and a `core` project which depends on the `macro` project.

The intent is for a simple and quick way to set up a macro project.
